# Blind test with crgrep and Elastic search
This example is specifically created to compare crgrep and elasticsearch in a blind test manner.

**Because data used in my comparison are all chinese books, therefor the error tolerant search is not used**

## Requirement

## Elastic search settings
```
```

## Result
See my post [here](https://cwayne.github.io/2017/03/28/More-on-crgrep/#more) for this comparison result.
